Users can click a word to play the pronunciation. Consonant-vowel patterns are automatically colorized and decorated with icons. There is a CMS to manually colorize any letter of any word. A previous developer spent two years on this and failed because he was following the teacher's architecture. I changed the architecture and built it in one month.",
