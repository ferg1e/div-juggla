# Div Juggla

The static site generator for my portfolio site [rysapps.com](https://www.rysapps.com).

## Install & Run

- `git clone https://github.com/ferg1e/div-juggla.git ssg`
- `cd ssg`
- `node index.js`
- Now you will see `index.html`, `projects.html` and `contact.html` in the `ssg` directory. These are the exact web pages you see on [rysapps.com](https://www.rysapps.com), except you will not have the project screenshot images and the project git visualizations.
